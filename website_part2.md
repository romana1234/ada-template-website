Definition of three time periods (P):

* P2: 1950 <= movie release year < 1980
* P3: 1980 <  movie release year

Very high correlation among the three periods of the same gender. Lower correlation between men and women. Highest correlation between P2 and P3 of the same gender (for both men and women).
